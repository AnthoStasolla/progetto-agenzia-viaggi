            Around 50 years ago, the editors of a magazine called Travel &
            Camera made a big leap forward, embracing not just photography, but
            the entire world. They'd cover food, wine, fashion, hotels, cruises,
            beaches, cities, hiking, skiing â€” just about anything that anybody
            would do for fun.
